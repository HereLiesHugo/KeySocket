## Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HereLiesHugo/KeySocket.git
cd KeySocket
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Enter your SSH server details:
   - **Host/IP Address**: The hostname or IP address of your SSH server
   - **Port**: SSH port (default: 22)
   - **Username**: Your SSH username
   - **Authentication**: Choose between password or private key authentication

2. Click "Connect to Server" to establish the SSH connection

3. Use the terminal just like you would use any SSH client

4. Click "Disconnect" when you're done

## Deployment to Render

This application is configured for easy deployment to Render:

1. Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account

2. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)

3. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"

4. Connect your GitHub repository

5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration

6. Click "Create Web Service"

Your KeySocket instance will be live at your Render URL!

## Memory Optimization for Free Hosting

This application is heavily optimized for free hosting tiers with limited memory (512MB):

### Server Optimizations:
- **Connection Limits**: Max 8 concurrent connections (configurable via `MAX_CONNECTIONS`)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Automatic garbage collection when memory usage exceeds 400MB
- **Buffer Management**: 8KB output buffer per connection with circular buffer implementation
- **Idle Cleanup**: Automatic disconnection of idle sessions after 3 minutes
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 2 SSH sessions per IP address
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of SSH streams and client connections

### Node.js Flags:
- `--max-old-space-size=450`: Limits heap size to 450MB (safe margin for 512MB limit)
- `--gc-interval=100`: More frequent garbage collection
- `--expose-gc`: Enables manual garbage collection during high memory usage

### Configuration:
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to customize settings:
```bash
MAX_CONNECTIONS=8          # Maximum concurrent connections
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=180000  # 3 minutes idle timeout
MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER_SIZE=8192 # 8KB buffer per connection
```

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

- This application is designed for personal use or trusted environments
- SSH credentials are not stored on the server
- All connections are established in real-time and closed when the browser disconnects
- Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse (2 connections per IP)
- Automatic cleanup prevents resource exhaustion
- For production use, consider adding:
  - HTTPS/TLS encryption
  - Authentication/authorization for the web interface
  - Enhanced logging and monitoring

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **SSH**: ssh2 library
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Frontend Terminal**: xterm.js
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
